### Getting Started with Phase 4 Ground and Space
---
#### The Basics
---

Do you want to join, participate, work on, contribute to, follow, or support the Phase 4 Ground and/or Space Projects?

1. Join the [mailing list](http://lists.openresearch.institute/listinfo.cgi/ground-station-openresearch.institute)

    The list is the easiest way to follow the project. Everybody should be on the mailing list. You might want to review the mailing list archives to see whatâ€™s been happening lately.

2. Request an invite to the [Phase 4 Slack Workspace](https://phase4ground.slack.com/) by sending an email to ori@openresearch.institute

    Slack workspace is for daily engineering discussions between the participants.

3. Get invited to the [Phase 4 Ground](https://github.com/phase4ground) and [Phase 4 Space](https://github.com/phase4space) repositories on GitHub by sending an email to ori@openresearch.institute

    This allows you to work on and contribute directly to all documents and source material for the project.

4. Read and commit to our [Developer and Participant Policies](https://www.openresearch.institute/developer-and-participant-policies/)

5. Introduce yourself! Welcome to the project, we are so happy you are here.

### Explore the Projects

Our current focus is on the Multiplexing Transponder Program (P4XT) under a [Phase 2 grant](https://www.ampr.org/grants/grant-open-research-institute-p4xt-phase-2/) received from [Amateur Radio Digital Communications](https://www.ampr.org).

The goal of P4XT is to produce open-source Digital Multiplexing Transponders (DMTs) for the Amateur Radio Service Microwave Bands. These DMTs will be suitable for deployment in both space and as terrestrial microwave stations. In addition, the program will produce a low-cost modem for use with these transponders. The communications systems enabled by these efforts are intended to greatly enhance the purposes of Amateur Radio and Amateur Radio Satellite services.

The transponder and modem are closely related in chicken and egg fashion. A functional system requires both and they must be fully compatible with each other. P4XT organizes these two efforts as separate co-projects that will be closely coordinated. We refer to the transponder project as P4XDMT. We refer to the modem project as P4XM.
